# Tarneeb Rules

Standard Rules

## Objective

Two teams of two partners compete to win **Tricks**. The goal is to reach the score limit (usually **31** or **41**).

## Setup & Deal

- **Deck:** Standard 52-card deck.
- **Cards Per Player:** 13 cards.
- **Dealing Method:** All **13 cards are dealt at once** to each player.
- **Starting Player:** The **Highest Bidder** (the Caller) leads the first trick after bidding concludes.

## Card Ranking

A standard 52-card deck is used. Ranking from high to low:

```
A  K  Q  J  10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2
```

_Play proceeds counter-clockwise._

## Bidding

Players bid on how many tricks their team can win (minimum **7**, maximum **13**).

The highest bidder becomes the **Caller** and chooses the Trump Suit (Tarneeb).

## Gameplay

- The Caller leads the first trick.
- Players must follow suit if able.
- If void in the suit led, you may play a Trump (to win) or discard.
- The highest card of the led suit wins, unless a Trump is played.

## Scoring

Points are calculated based on the Caller's bid and the actual tricks taken.

| Scenario     | Points Awarded |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Caller Wins  | + Tricks Taken |
| Caller Fails | - Bid Amount   |
| Opponents    | + Tricks Taken |

_Example: If you bid 7 and take 9 tricks, you get +9. If you bid 7 and take 6, you get -7._

## Winning the Game

The first team to reach the score limit wins.

If both teams pass the limit in the same round, the team with the **highest score** wins. If tied, play continues.
